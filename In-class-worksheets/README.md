# Welcome to The Federal R&D Budget Data Exploration

## Overview 
### **Project Goal**:
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between GDP and Federal R&D Budgets (by department), with a focus on understanding how research and development investments correlate with economic growth. The project utilizes Pandas and Matplotlib.
### Tidy Data Principles:
This project uses the Tidy Data framework, which promotes a well-organized data structure designed to enhance clarity, simplify analysis, and improve visualization. 

According to the Tidy Data framework, a data set must follow these three principles:

1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

## Instructions
### **How to Run the Notebook**

Follow these simple steps to run the notebook:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib notebook
2. **Download the Project Files**

3. **Open and Run the Notebook**
- Navigate to the project folder in Jupyter.
- Open the notebook file (e.g., TidyData_Analysis.ipynb
- Run Each Cell  or just choose Run All at the top of the notebook


##  About the Data Set

- Includes data on **federal departments**, their **R&D budgets**, and **GDP** from **1967 to 2017**.  
- Each row represents a unique combination of **department**, **year**, and **budget** data.  
- Covers **14 federal departments** plus an **"Other"** category for miscellaneous R&D spending.
