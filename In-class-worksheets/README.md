# Welcome to The Federal R&D Budget Data Exploration

## Overview 
### **Project Goal**:
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between GDP and R&D Budget (by department), with a focus on understanding how research and development investments correlate with economic growth. The project utilizes Pandas and Matplotlib.
### Tidy Data Principles:
This project uses the Tidy Data framework, which promotes a well-organized data structure designed to enhance clarity, simplify analysis, and improve visualization. 

According to the Tidy Data framework, a data set must follow these three principles:

1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table
