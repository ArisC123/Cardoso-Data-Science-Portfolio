# Cardoso-Data-Science-Portfolio
## Purpose For This Portfolio  
#### This repository, Cardoso Data Science Portfolio, serves as a showcase of my data science skills, projects, and achievements. It highlights my ability to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from data, as well as develop and deploy machine learning models

 ### Projects:
 
#### Basic Streamlit App: [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/ArisC123/Cardoso-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
- An interactive **Streamlit** app that visualizes data on penguin species, showcasing my skills in web app development and data visualization. Features include dynamic charts, data filtering, and a user-friendly interface for exploring penguin characteristics.

#### Tidy Data Project: [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/ArisC123/Cardoso-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
- This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization by utilizing tidy data principles. Using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**, highlighting my ability to organize data for clear insights and analysis in my portfolio

#### Machine Learning Streamlit App: [MLStreamlitApp](https://github.com/ArisC123/Cardoso-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)
- This project showcases my skills in machine learning model building and evaluation through an interactive **Streamlit** app. It highlights my ability to integrate user interaction with model training, hyperparameter tuning, visualizations, and deployment-ready code. Using **Scikit-learn** and **Matplotlib**, highlighting my ability to train, tune, and visually interpret classification models and their evaluation metrics

 
Each project will have its own folder
Each folder will include:
- A README.md file summarizing the project's objective, methodology, and key results.
- Relevant code files
- Any outputs, such as reports or visualizations.
- Supporting data files
