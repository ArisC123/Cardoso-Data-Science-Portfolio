# 🎯 Welcome to The Federal R&D Budget Dataset Exploration

## 📄 Overview 
### **📌 Project Goal**:
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between 📈 **GDP** and Federal **R&D Budgets** (by department), with a focus on understanding how research and development investments correlate with economic growth. The project utilizes **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

### 📊 Tidy Data Principles:
This project uses the **Tidy Data** framework, which promotes a well-organized data structure designed to enhance clarity, simplify analysis, and improve visualization. 

According to the Tidy Data framework, a dataset must follow these three principles:

1️⃣ Each variable forms a column  
2️⃣ Each observation forms a row  
3️⃣ Each type of observational unit forms a table
